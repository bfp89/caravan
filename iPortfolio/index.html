            <p>
              I’m an experienced Learning & Development trainer, and have worked in this area for over 7 years, however I have now decided to take on a new challenge and change my life for the better. I got to a point with my career where I didnt want to just go to work beacuse I had to, I wanted to work in a field that truly engaged me. 
              Most importantly though, I want to work in a field where I can use my skills and strengths, such as on the spot problem solving and creativity, on a more regular basis. I believe Web/software development will provide just that.
              <br><br>
              I have always harboured an interest in various forms of software design, and have engaged in it’s commercial/rudimentary forms from a young age. Whether it be designing my own maps/quests on various games, or simply adding a funky font on myspace, I have always enjoyed it. 
             <br></br>
              I work incredibly well as part of a rounded team, but am equally comfortable working alone, with my excellent written and verbal communication skills enabling me to do this well, and setting me apart from most. Having spent my time in lockdown completing a full stack course, I feel I’m ready to seize a chance at a new challenge, and am extremely optimistic about my future and the opportunities to learn and grow that this industry can provide.

              <div class="portfolio-links">

            </div>
            <p>This directory with full CRUD functionality presented a unique challenge to myself; how to create something ive seen in many forms over the years, ensure it has full functionality, is simple for any user to pick up quickly, and has a smooth feel to it's use.
              <br><br>
              I started by listing the things I wanted it to do, then decided on using individual cards for each employee for the design. I felt this would make it more aesthetically pleasing for the user seeing each emplyee laid out, and then to be able to select information for that employee.
              <br><br>
              I found it genuinely fun to work on, as creating all the functionality while making sure it fit the brief and design was like putting together a puzzle, piece by piece. If one piece didn't match and I found an error, then I had to step back, look at the whole puzzle and try and see which piece didnt fit correctly. 
              <br>There were things that took me a while to work out, but I kept at the front of my mind exactly how it was supposed to function, and this helped to ensure the piece fit the brief and functioned as required.

            </div>
            <p>The Gazetteer app was my first proper foray into the world of developing alone and from a brief. I struggled initially to know where to begin, it being a large piece of work and something i had not done before. It took lots of research into the concepts and several discussions with my personal tutor to ensure I fully understood what was expected of me.
              <br><br>
              However I found myself learning a huge amount through that process, and developed further skills in taking it upon myself to learn new concepts from a realitively low base level.
              <br><br>
              It was one of the harder things I've done, but I remained resiliant throughout and stuck to it, managing to produce a fully functioning, cross-device app in the process.
